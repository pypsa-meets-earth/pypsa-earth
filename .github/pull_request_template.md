## Checklist

- [ ] I consent to the release of this PR's code under the AGPLv3 license and non-code contributions under CC0-1.0 and CC-BY-4.0.
- [ ] I tested my contribution locally and it seems to work fine.
- [ ] Code and workflow changes are sufficiently documented.
- [ ] Newly introduced dependencies are added to `envs/environment.yaml` and `doc/requirements.txt`.
- [ ] Changes in configuration options are added all into a relevant config in `configs` folder, and if needed also to `config.default.yaml` and `config.tutorial.yaml`. A general recommendation is to keep in `config.default.yaml` only the parameters which customization is needed for the most modeling runs.
- [ ] Add a test config or line additions to `test/` (note tests are changing the config.tutorial.yaml)
- [ ] Changes in configuration options are also documented in `doc/configtables/*.csv` and line references are adjusted in `doc/configuration.rst` and `doc/tutorial.rst`.
- [ ] A note for the release notes `doc/release_notes.rst` is amended in the format of previous release notes, including reference to the requested PR.
