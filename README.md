**Disclaimer: PyPSA-Earth-Sec is still under development.**

The model currently covers one country, Morocco, in a simplistic representation with 4 nodes (simplistic). A prerequisite for a successful model run is built network generated by pypsa-earth. Currently, no real demand data is used for the country inspected, instead, we use dummy data that is either taken from a different country relying on the data used in pypsa-eur-sec or generated using heuristics.

The model now includes the following energy carriers: **electricity**, **hydrogen**, **fossil gas** and *fossil oil** and includes **carbon** as gas emissions and feedstock for the synthesis of the carriers.

The demand sectors covered are: **residential**, **industry**, **land transport**, **aviation** and **shipping**.

The diagram below depicts one representative clustered node showing the combination of carriers and sectors covered in the model as well as the generation and conversion technologies included.

## Installation

1. Open your terminal at a location where you want to install pypsa-earth-sec. Type the following in your terminal to download the package and the dependency (pypsa-earth) from GitHub:

```bash
    .../some/path/without/spaces % git clone https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth.git
    .../some/path/without/spaces % git clone https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth-sec.git
```

2. The python package requirements are curated in the `envs/environment.yaml` file.
   The environment can be installed using:

```bash
    .../some/path/without/spaces % cd pypsa-earth
    .../pypsa-earth % conda env create -f envs/environment.yaml
```

3. For running the optimization one has to install the solver. We can recommend the open source HiGHs solver which installation manual is given [here](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA/blob/633669d3f940ea256fb0a2313c7a499cbe0122a5/pypsa/linopt.py#L608-L632).

4. To use jupyter lab (new jupyter notebooks) **continue** with the [ipython kernel installation](http://echrislynch.com/2019/02/01/adding-an-environment-to-jupyter-notebooks/) and test if your jupyter lab works:

```bash
    .../pypsa-earth % ipython kernel install --user --name=pypsa-earth

    .../pypsa-earth % jupyter lab
```

## Test run on tutorial

- In the folder open a terminal/command window to be located at this path `~/pypsa-earth-sec/`
- Activate the environment `conda activate pypsa-earth`
- Run a dryrun of the Snakemake workflow by typing simply in the terminal:
  ```bash
  snakemake -j 1 solve_all_networks -n
  ```
  Remove the -n to do a real run. Follow the tutorial of PyPSA-Eur 1 and 2 on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty47YU1_eeQ) to continue with an analysis.
