Project structure and credits
##########################################

The PyPSA-Earth model is maintained by the members of the PyPSA meets Earth initiative.
We implemented in the initiative a project structure to enhance collaboration and give people responsibilities.
Therefore, the structure is not here to dictate, it is rather a structure that let people organize and think from different angles about the project.

We all have the same goal. We want to create a long-term maintained, supported and steadily improving energy system model that is useful for industry and research. Every person helping towards achieving this goal is listed in the credits.

Project structure
==================

PyPSA-meets-Earth initiative is build upon the code base which can be accessed from the initiative repository on GitHub. A list below aims to give a quick overview:

- `PyPSA Earth <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth>`__ is a model for power or sector-coupled system modeling for any country of the world
- `PyPSA Distribution <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-distribution>`__ is an optimization model for micro-grids and distribution grids with an automated extraction of the inputs needed to build grid topology and electricity load profiles https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-distribution
- `Earth OSM <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/earth-osm>`__ provides a toolset to download, pre-process and export energy-relevant infrastructure data from OpenStreetMap (OSM)

The list is by no means exhaustive and is growing continuously. Feel free to explore more looking into the repositories available in `PyPSA meets Earth organization <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth>`__ and don't forget to give us a star ;). The contributions are very welcome to enhance the description of the available projects!
