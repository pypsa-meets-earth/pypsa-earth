Workflow
========

The generation of the model is controlled by the workflow management system `Snakemake <https://snakemake.bitbucket.io/>`_. In a nutshell,
the ``Snakefile`` declares for each python script in the ``scripts`` directory a rule which describes which files the scripts consume and
produce (their corresponding input and output files). The ``snakemake`` tool then runs the scripts in the correct order according to the
rules' input/output dependencies. Moreover, it is able to track, what parts of the workflow have to be regenerated, when a data file or a
script is modified/updated. For example, by executing the following snakemake routine

.. code:: bash

    .../pypsa-earth % snakemake -j 1 networks/elec_s_128.nc

the following workflow is automatically executed.

.. image:: img/workflow_introduction.png
    :align: center

The **blocks** represent the individual rules which are required to create the file ``networks/elec_s_128.nc``.
Each rule requires scripts (e.g. Python) to convert inputs to outputs.
The **arrows** indicate the outputs from preceding rules which a particular rule takes as input data.

.. note::
    For reproducibility purposes, the image can be obtained through
    ``snakemake --dag networks/elec_s_128.nc | dot -Tpng -o workflow.png``
    using `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`_


Folder structure
================

The content in this package is organized in folders as described below; for more details, please see the documentation.

- ``data``: Includes input data that is not produced by any ``snakemake`` rule.
- ``scripts``: Includes all the Python scripts executed by the ``snakemake`` rules.
- ``resources``: Stores intermediate results of the workflow which can be picked up again by subsequent rules.
- ``networks``: Stores intermediate, unsolved stages of the PyPSA network that describes the energy system model.
- ``results``: Stores the solved PyPSA network data, summary files and plots.
- ``benchmarks``: Stores ``snakemake`` benchmarks.
- ``logs``: Stores log files about solving, including the solver output, console output and the output of a memory logger.
- ``envs``: Stores the conda environment files to successfully run the workflow.
