,Unit,Values,Description
formulation,--,"{angles, kirchhoff, cycles, ptdf}","Specifies which variant of linearized power flow formulations to use in the optimisation problem. Recommended is 'kirchhoff'."
load_shedding,--,"Either 'false' or float","Add generators with a prohibitively high marginal cost to simulate load shedding. Choose 'false' to turn off or alternatively add willingness to pay for load shedding in EUR/kWh"
noisy_costs,bool,"{true, false}","Add random noise to marginal cost of generators and capital cost of lines and links."
min_iterations,--,int,"Minimum number of solving iterations in between which resistance and reactance (x/r) are updated for branches according to s_nom_opt of the previous run."
max_iterations,--,int,"Maximum number of solving iterations in between which resistance and reactance (x/r) are updated for branches according to s_nom_opt of the previous run."
clip_p_max_pu,p.u.,float,"To avoid too small values in the renewables per-unit availability time series values below this threshold are set to zero."
skip_iterations,bool,"{true, false}","Skip iterating, do not update impedances of branches."
track_iterations,bool,"{true, false}","Flag whether to store the intermediate branch capacities and objective function values are recorded for each iteration."
nhours,--,int,"Specifies the n first snapshots to take into account. Must be less than the total number of snapshots. Recommended only for debugging."
