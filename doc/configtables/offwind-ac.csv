,Unit,Values,Description
cutout,--,"Should be a file name listed in the configuration ``atlite: cutouts:`` (e.g. 'europe-2013-era5') or reference an existing folder in the directory ``cutouts``. Source module must be ERA5.","Specifies the directory where the relevant weather data ist stored."
resource,,,
-- method,--,"Must be 'wind'","A superordinate technology type."
-- turbine,--,"One of turbine types included in `atlite <https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite/tree/master/atlite/resources/windturbine>`_","Specifies the turbine type and its characteristic power curve."
capacity_per_sqkm,:math:`MW/km^2`,float,"Allowable density of wind turbine placement."
correction_factor,, "[0., 1.]", "Wind correction factor to account for wake losses. It gets multiplied by the theoretical maximum in the cutout to account for wake losses."
copernicus,,,
-- grid_codes,--,"Any subset of the `Copernicus Land Cover code list <https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover/clc2018>`_","Specifies areas based on CLC which generally eligible for AC-connected offshore wind turbine placement."
natura,bool,"{true, false}","Switch to exclude `Natura 2000 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natura_2000>`_ natural protection areas. Area is excluded if ``true``."
max_depth,m,float,"Maximum sea water depth at which wind turbines can be build. Maritime areas with deeper waters are excluded in the process of calculating the AC-connected offshore wind potential."
max_shore_distance,m,float,"Maximum distance to the shore beyond which wind turbines with AC connections cannot be build. Such areas far away from shore are excluded in the process of calculating the AC-connected offshore wind potential."
potential,--,"One of {'simple', 'conservative'}","Method to compute the maximal installable potential for a node; confer :ref:`renewableprofiles`"
clip_p_max_pu,p.u.,float,"To avoid too small values in the renewables` per-unit availability time series values below this threshold are set to zero."
extendable, bool, "{True, False}", "True: In nodes where there is no offwind-ac generation, adds a zero-capacity offwind-ac generator so that offwind-ac is considered for capacity expansion. It is done in the ``add_electricity`` rule."
