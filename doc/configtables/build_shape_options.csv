,Unit,Values,Description
gadm_layer_id,,"{0,1,2}","GADM level area used for the gadm_shapes. Codes are country-dependent but roughly: 0: country,1: region/county-like,2: municipality-like."
simplify_gadm,bool,"{True, False}","True: shape polygons are simplified else no"
update_file, bool,"{True, False}","True: all input files are downloaded again and replace the existing files."
out_logging, bool,"{True, False}","True: Logging is printed in the console."
year,,"past year; e.g. YYYY","Reference year used to derive shapes info on population and info on GDP."
nprocesses, int,,"Number of processes to be used in build_shapes."
worldpop_method,,"{standard,api, false}","""Specifies how population is added to every shape: ""standard"" pulls from web 1kmx1km raster; ""api"" pulls from API 100mx100m raster; false (not ""false"") no population addition to shape. This is useful when generating only cutout."""
gdp_method,,"""{""standard"",""false""}""","""Specifies how GDP is added to every shape: ""standard"" pulls from web 1x1km raster; false (not ""false"") no gdp addition to shape. This is useful when generating only cutout."""
contended_flag,,"""{""set_by_country"",""drop""}""","""Specifies what to do with contended countries: ""set_by_country"" assigns the contended areas to the countries according to the GADM database; ""drop"" drops the contended areas from the model."""
