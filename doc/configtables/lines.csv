,Unit,Values,Description
ac_types,--,"Values should specify a `line type in PyPSA <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#line-types>`_ for AC lines. Keys should specify the corresponding voltage level (e.g. 220., 300. and 380. kV)", "Specifies line types to assume for the different voltage levels of the target region. Should normally handle voltage levels 220, 300, and 380 kV."
dc_types, --, "Values should specify a `line type in PyPSA <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#line-types>`_ for DC-lines. Keys should specify the corresponding voltage level (e.g. 220., 300. and 380. kV)", "Specifies DC-line types."
s_max_pu,--,"Value in [0.,1.]","Correction factor for line capacities (``s_nom``) to approximate :math:`N-1` security and reserve capacity for reactive power flows"
s_nom_max,MW,"float","Global upper limit for the maximum capacity of each extendable line."
s_nom_max_min,MW,"float","Global lower limit for the maximum capacity of each extendable line."
length_factor,--,float,"Correction factor to account for the fact that buses are *not* connected by lines through air-line distance."
under_construction,--,"One of {'zero': set capacity to zero, 'remove': remove completely, 'keep': keep with full capacity}","Specifies how to handle lines which are currently under construction."
