-- hydrogen,,,
-- -- temporal_matching,--,"One of {'h2_yearly_matching', 'h2_monthly_matching', 'no_res_matching'}",Specifies the temporal matching method for hydrogen production and renewable energy.
-- -- spatial_matching,bool,"{true, false}",Indicates whether spatial matching is applied for hydrogen production.
-- -- additionality,bool,"{true, false}","If true, ensures renewable electricity is equal to the amount required for additional hydrogen export compared to the reference case without hydrogen export."
-- -- allowed_excess,p.u.,float,Defines the allowable excess renewable energy for hydrogen production.
-- -- is_reference,bool,"{true, false}",Indicates whether the network is a reference case for additionality calculations. It is relavant only if ``additionality`` is true.
-- -- remove_h2_load,bool,"{true, false}",Specifies whether to remove hydrogen load from the network in the reference case. It is relevant only if ``is_reference`` is true.
-- -- path_to_ref,--,string,Path to the reference case network for additionality calculation. It is relevant only if ``addtionality`` is true and ``is_reference`` is false.
-- -- re_country_load,bool,"{true, false}","If true, forces renewable electricity to match hydrogen export and country electricity load. If false, renewable electricity is only matched to hydrogen export."
