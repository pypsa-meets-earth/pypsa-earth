,Unit,Values,Description
-- simplify_network,,,
-- -- to_substations,bool,"true/false","Aggregates all nodes without power injection (positive or negative, i.e. demand or generation) to electrically closest ones"
-- -- algorithm,str,"One of {‘kmeans’, ‘hac’, ‘modularity‘}}","Clustering algorithm"
-- -- feature,str,"Str in the format ‘carrier1+carrier2+...+carrierN-X’, where CarrierI can be from {‘solar’, ‘onwind’, ‘offwind’, ‘ror’} and X is one of {‘cap’, ‘time’}.","Is used for hierarchical clustering"
-- -- exclude_carriers,list,"List of Str like [ 'solar', 'onwind'] or empy list []","List of carriers which will not be aggregated. If empty, all carriers will be aggregated."
-- -- remove_stubs,bool,"true/false",
-- remove stubs,bool,"true/false","Controls whether radial parts of the network should be recursively aggregated. Defaults to true."
-- -- remove_stubs_across_borders,bool,"true/false","Controls whether radial parts of the network should be recursively aggregated across borders. Defaults to true."
-- -- p_threshold_drop_isolated,--,float,"Isolated buses are being discarded if bus mean power is below the specified threshold."
-- -- p_threshold_merge_isolated,--,float,"Isolated buses are being merged into a single isolated bus if bus mean power is above the specified threshold."

-- out_logging," bool"," when true logging is printed to console",
-- aggregation_strategies,,,
-- -- generators,,,
-- -- -- {key},str,"{key} can be any of the component of the generator (str). It’s value can be any that can be converted to pandas.Series using getattr(). For example one of {min, max, sum}.","Aggregates the component according to the given strategy. For example, if sum, then all values within each cluster are summed to represent the new generator."
