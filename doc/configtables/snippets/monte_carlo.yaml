monte_carlo:
  # Description: Specify Monte Carlo sampling options for uncertainty analysis.
  # Define the option list for Monte Carlo sampling.
  # Make sure add_to_snakefile is set to true to enable Monte-Carlo
  options:
    add_to_snakefile: false # When set to true, enables Monte Carlo sampling
    samples: 9 # number of optimizations. Note that number of samples when using scipy has to be the square of a prime number
    sampling_strategy: "chaospy" # "pydoe2", "chaospy", "scipy", packages that are supported
    seed: 42 # set seedling for reproducibilty
  # Uncertanties on any PyPSA object are specified by declaring the specific PyPSA object under the key 'uncertainties'.
  # For each PyPSA object, the 'type' and 'args' keys represent the type of distribution and its argument, respectively.
  # Supported distributions types are uniform, normal, lognormal, triangle, beta and gamma.
  # The arguments of the distribution are passed using the key 'args'  as follows, tailored by distribution type
  # normal: [mean, std], lognormal: [mean, std], uniform: [lower_bound, upper_bound],
  # triangle: [mid_point (between 0 - 1)], beta: [alpha, beta], gamma: [shape, scale]
  # More info on the distributions are documented in the Chaospy reference guide...
  # https://chaospy.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/distribution/index.html
  # An abstract example is as follows:
  # {pypsa network object, e.g. "loads_t.p_set"}:
  # type: {any supported distribution among the previous: "uniform", "normal", ...}
  # args: {arguments passed as a list depending on the distribution, see the above and more at https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/}
