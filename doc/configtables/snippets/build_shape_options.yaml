build_shape_options:
  gadm_layer_id: 1  # GADM level area used for the gadm_shapes. Codes are country-dependent but roughly: 0: country, 1: region/county-like, 2: municipality-like

  nprocesses: 3  # number of processes to be used in build_shapes
  worldpop_method: standard  # "standard" pulls from web 1kmx1km raster, "api" pulls from API 100mx100m raster,
  # false (not "false") no pop addition to shape which is useful when generating only cutout
  gdp_method: standard  # "standard" pulls from web 1x1km raster, false (not "false") no gdp addition to shape which useful when generating only cutout
  contended_flag: set_by_country  # "set_by_country" assigns the contended areas to the countries according to the GADM database, "drop" drops these contended areas from the model
