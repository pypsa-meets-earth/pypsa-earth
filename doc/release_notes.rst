Upcoming release
================

This part of documentation collects descriptive release notes to capture the main improvements introduced by developing the model before the next release.

**New Features and Major Changes**

* Add an option to redefine countries into subregions which can be activated at various stages of the workflow. The subregions can be defined either by the GADM_ID or a custom map.

PyPSA-Earth 0.5.0
=================

**New Features and Major Changes (14th December 2024)**

* Added capabilities of cross-sectoral modeling by merging with PyPSA-Earth-Sec model `https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth-sec`__

* The workflow configuration now supports incremental changes to the default configuration in the `config.yaml` and configfiles passed to snakemake via `--configfile myconfig.yaml`. Therefore the user may now only include settings in their `config.yaml` which differ from the default configuration. One can think of the new `config.yaml` as of a list of arguments in a python function that already have a default. So in principle the `config.yaml` could now be empty, and the workflow would still run. `PR #1053 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1053>`__

* Include option of endogenous export, which optimizes the export quantity based on price signals `PR #1201 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1201>`__

* Integrate RDIR into sector rules to store intermediate data in scenario folders `PR #1154 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1154>`__

* The computation of `hydro_profile.nc` in `build_renewable_profiles.py` is not differentiated whether alternative clustering is applied or not; the indexing of the different power plants in `add_electricity.py` is performed according to the bus either in case alternative clustering is applied or not and a `hydro_inflow_factor` is computed prior to the computation of `inflow_t` to split the inflow according to the capacity of each different unit of each power plant (if more units are present). `PR #1119 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1119>`__

* Use BASE_DIR in rules and `_helpers.py` script for facilitate module import in subworkflow `PR #1137 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1137>`__

* Enable sector rules import in subworkflow `PR #1178 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1178>`__

* Drop duplicate entries in `AL_production.csv` data used in `build_industry_demand` rule `PR #1143 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1143>`__

* Fix bugs in `prepare_sector_network.py` related to links with H2 buses and bug of re-addition of H2 and battery carriers in present `PR #1145 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1145>`__

* Drop entries that contain non-string elements in country column of `CO2_emissions_csv` data in `prepare_transport_data_input.py` script `PR #1166 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1166>`__

* Local tests are now run with `make test`. This uses a `Makefile` which runs snakemake calls with different configurations. `PR #1053 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1053>`__

* Adds CI to update keep pinned environment files up to date. `PR #1183 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1183>`__ and  `PR #1210 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1210>`__
