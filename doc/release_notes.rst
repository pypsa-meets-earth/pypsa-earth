PyPSA-Earth 0.5.0
=================

**New Features and Major Changes (14th December 2024)**

* Added capabilities of cross-sectoral modeling by merging with PyPSA-Earth-Sec model `https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth-sec`__

* The workflow configuration now supports incremental changes to the default configuration in the `config.yaml` and configfiles passed to snakemake via `--configfile myconfig.yaml`. Therefore the user may now only include settings in their `config.yaml` which differ from the default configuration. One can think of the new `config.yaml` as of a list of arguments in a python function that already have a default. So in principle the `config.yaml` could now be empty, and the workflow would still run. `PR #1053 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1053>`__

* Include option of endogenous export, which optimizes the export quantity based on price signals `PR #1201 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1201>`__

* The computation of `hydro_profile.nc` in `build_renewable_profiles.py` is not differentiated whether alternative clustering is applied or not; the indexing of the different power plants in `add_electricity.py` is performed according to the bus either in case alternative clustering is applied or not and a `hydro_inflow_factor` is computed prior to the computation of `inflow_t` to split the inflow according to the capacity of each different unit of each power plant (if more units are present). `PR #1119 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1119>`__

* Use BASE_DIR in rules and `_helpers.py` script for facilitate module import in subworkflow `PR #1137 <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth/pull/1137>`__
