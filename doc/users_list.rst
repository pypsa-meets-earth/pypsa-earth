The list below contains some the applications of PyPSA-Earth for educational, research and industrial projects and is likely to be incomplete. If you want to add your contribution into the list, feel free to open a PR to `PyPSA Earth repo <https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth>`__ or flag your interest via `PyPSA meets Earth Discord server <https://discord.gg/AnuJBk23FU>`__.

* Evaluation of potential decarbonization pathways for **Bangladesh’s** power sector up to 2050 considering economic cost efficiency as well as implications for land availability and employment by South and South-East Asia Multidisciplinary Applied Research Network on Transforming Societies of Global South `SMARTS center <https://smartscenter.ait.ac.th/>`__ of Asian Institute of Technology and `International University of Business Agriculture and Technology <https://iubat.edu/>`__. The major outcomes of the study are published as `a research paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ref.2024.100655>`__.

* Power system modeling for **Korea** to support development of the national energy strategy, considering ESS Capacity expansion, LMP & Cost analysis according to ESS combination, and coal phase-out scenario (`Energy Innovation Lab <https://energyinnovation.korea.ac.kr/>`__ at `Korea University <https://www.korea.ac.kr/sites/ko/index.do>`__)

* Development a model for the **Pakistan** Power System (Soon available on GitHub in PyPSA-Earth's repository) cross-referenced and validated with national reports. The model has been used to develop the Net-Zero scenario by 2050 utilizing Pakistan's eligible Wind and Solar potential. The modeling study has been done as a part of Master Work in Mehran University of Engineering and Technology as presented in the `post <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdulkarimshah_thesisdefense-gratitude-energymodeling-activity-7268980842490724352-mp_M/>`__

* A power system model for **Bolivia** to support implementation of the energy transition in the country, considering both dispatch optimization and capacity expansion by `Université de Liège <https://www.uliege.be/>`__ and `Universidad Mayor de San Simón <https://www.umss.edu.bo/>`__ published as a conference paper available `here <https://www.proceedings.com/content/069/069564-0181open.pdf>`__

* Investigation of implications of the national decarbonisaiton goals for power system of **Kazakhstan**. Traditionally, Kazakhstan’s power sector is using a lot of coal, while the national plans introduce a significant increase in solar and wind generation during the next decades. Model Kazakhstan power system has been used to investigate economic feasibility of going even beyond the official mid-term goal of 15% renewable energy share by 2030 in a joint project developed by Open Energy Transition and Agora Energiewende which `report <https://www.agora-energiewende.org/publications/modernising-kazakhstans-coal-dependent-power-sector-through-renewables>`__ has been published openly.

* Country-wise validation of PyPSA-Earth methodology to extract modeling-ready data for power system modeling considering **any country on the Earth** published as a `conference paper <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10257559>`__. Results confirm that PyPSA-Earth now covers approximately 99% of the world's population and can generate high-resolution datasets for national energy studies. The supplementary data for fully reproducible 193+ power systems images created with PyPSA-Earth for all United Nations countries are available in `zenodo repozitory <https://zenodo.org/records/10080766>`__.

* **Multi-Country Electricity Transition Potential and Challenges Project** (MCET) of `Environmental Defence Fund <https://www.edf.org/work/economics-energy-transition#:~:text=The%20Multi%2DCountry%20Electricity%20Transition,to%20decarbonize%20their%20electricity%20sectors>`__. The goal was to analyze barriers to decarbonisation in **China**, **India**, **Colombia**, **Chile**, **Kazakhstan**, **Bangladesh**, **Vietnam** and **Thailand** for power system planning in deep decarbonisation scenarios.

* Investigation of the energy transition pathways for **Nigeria** published in a `research paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121096>`__ by a joint team of PyPSA-Earth developers. Capabilities of PyPSA-Earth model has been showcased by considering two least-cost power system optimizations, one for 2020 to reproduce the historical system behavior and one representing a decarbonised 2060 scenario.

* Modeling of the power sector in **Saudi Arabia** published as `MSc dissertation <https://zenodo.org/records/7017741>`__ in Edinburgh University. This has been a first attempt to predict the energy system for Saudi Arabia in 2060, with net zero emissions. The models in this study include a base model for validation, a model for 2030, to compare to the country’s Vision 2030 and as a transition phase, and two models for 2060 net zero, one is fully renewable and the other utilizing carbon capture and storage technology. The outputs of the work are available in the `repository <https://github.com/AnasAlgarei/PyPSA-KSA>`__.
