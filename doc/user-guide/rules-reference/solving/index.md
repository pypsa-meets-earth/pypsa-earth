# Solving

After generating and simplifying the networks they can be solved through the `solve_network` rule by using the collection rule `solve_all_networks`.

Moreover, networks can be solved for another focus with the derivative rules `solve_operations_network` for dispatch-only analyses on an already solved network.

## Rules

- **[solve_network](solve-network.md)** - Runs the optimization to solve the network for optimal dispatch and investment.

- **[solve_operations_network](solve-operations-network.md)** - Runs dispatch-only optimization on an already solved network.
