# Model customization

The aim of this section is to guide through the main steps which are needed to build a full-scale model to solve your energy study problem.

To simplify navigation through this section, we offer a summary as follows:

1. **[Basic Setup](customization/basic-setup.md):** Provides guidance on customizing the default configuration file to suit specific modeling needs, including specifying the country/region of interest and enabling essential data downloads.

2. **[Running Models](customization/running-models.md):** Explains the process of running the model using the Snakemake workflow management tool, selecting a solver, and ensuring successful optimization.

3. **[Validation](customization/validation.md):** Outlines procedures for validating data obtained from PyPSA-Earth, including simulation procedures, reference data sources, and advanced validation examples.

4. **[Copernicus Data](customization/copernicus-data.md):** Describes the steps to access the Copernicus Climate Data Store for building custom cutouts, including registration, setting up the CDS API key, and considerations for cutout generation.

Each section provides essential information for effective model usage and customization, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
